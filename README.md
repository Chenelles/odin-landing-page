# odin-landing-page
My first landing page! 
As it's my first project I believe it has at least a couple of mistakes which I intend to fix once I progress and improve my skills. I did try to apply simple rules of accessibility as well as proper html semantics for SEO reasons.
My first version of this website is not responsive but it will be corrected in the future.

Any feedback is most welcome!
